# Arduino Uno Tilt Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a tilt sensor with an Arduino Uno to detect orientation changes. It reads the state of the tilt sensor and displays the status via the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Tilt Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Tilt Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the tilt sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC and GND of the tilt sensor to the respective power and ground pins on the Arduino Uno or an external power supply.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the tilt sensor to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Tilt the sensor module and observe the state change in the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Orientation Sensing:** Use for detecting tilt or orientation changes in devices or objects.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate with alarms or notifications based on tilt conditions.
- **Educational Projects:** Learn about digital input handling and sensor integration with microcontrollers.

#### Notes

- Ensure the tilt sensor is securely mounted and calibrated for accurate detection.
- Adjust sensitivity or debounce techniques for reliable tilt detection in specific applications.
- Explore using multiple tilt sensors for more complex orientation sensing tasks.
